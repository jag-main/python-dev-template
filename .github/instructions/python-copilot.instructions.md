## 🧠 Code Review Guidelines

- Highlight potential performance concerns and explain the **computer science concepts** behind them (e.g., time/space complexity, I/O, memory access patterns).
- Promote **clean, Pythonic code** that prioritizes readability and maintainability.
- Recommend improvements only when they follow sound **design principles**:
  - **SOLID** principles
  - **Well-known design patterns**
- Encourage architectural clarity when appropriate.
- **Do not refactor unnecessarily.** Every suggestion should improve readability, performance, or maintainability.
- For big important changes, **explain the reasoning** behind them and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- When files, libraries, or tools are referenced:
  - **Inspect them directly** — do not guess or hallucinate.
  - Plan tool usage thoroughly before executing.
  - Reflect on tool outputs before proceeding.
